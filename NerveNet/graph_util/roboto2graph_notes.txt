Walker:
 - root / robot body
	- z position
	- yaw (relative target rotation 1)
	- yaw (relative target rotation 2)
	- robot speed x
	- robot speed y
	- robot speed z
	- roll 
	- pitch 
 - j (ordered_joints): 1x(2*num_joints) ndarray with (2*8 for Ant-V1)
   - 0, 2, 4, ... joint position
   - 1, 3, 5, ... joint angular speed
    # even elements [0::2] position, scaled to -1..+1 between limits
    # odd elements  [1::2] angular speed, scaled to show -1..+1
 - feet_contact 
   - for every foot 0 or 1
